- Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
- Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being 
explicitly programmed where to look.

Data Acquisition -> Data Cleaning -> Test Data -> Model Testing -> Model Deployment
                         (70-80%) -> Model Training -> Model Testing  -> Model Deployment
                         
Supervised Learning
- You have labeled data and are trying to predict a label based off of known features.
- Use labeled data

Unsupervised Learning
- You have unlabeled data and are trying to group together similar data points based off of features

Reinforcement Learning
- Algorithms learns to perform an action from experience.
