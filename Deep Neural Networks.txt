CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
- Used for image classification

Traditional Approach
- requires domain
- not scalable

Deep Learning Approach 
- More accurate
- Easy to scale

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Solves the problem through modeling recurrent data
- Whenever dataset is dependent on previous points, the data is said to be sequential.
- RNNs can be used to predict the stock market price of tomorrow.
- RNNs can be used for word suggestions in text messaging and language translation.
- Can also be used for speech to text translation.
