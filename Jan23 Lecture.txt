Data Science = CS + Statistics + Domain Knowledge
Machine Learning 
    Arthur Samuel: "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
    
Data Science, Deep Learning, AI, ML
Deep Learning 1940
- type of ML & AI that resembles the human gain certain 
types of knowledge
- includes statistics and predictive modeling 
- makes processes simpler and easier for DS to gather, analyze, and interpret massive amounts of data.
- Neural Networks 
  - ANN, CNN, RNN
  - ANN Artificial NN
      - inspired by the animal brain.
  - CNN Convolutional NN
      - surpasses other NN when given inputs such as
      images, voice, (NLP, speech recognition, image)
      - Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Assistant
     - RNN 
       Sequential data or series
 
 - ML 1943
   - a branch of AI and CS focuses on using data and
   algorithm to imitate how humans think 
   - mathemetical modeling of NN served as the basis for 
   invention of ML in 3 types: 
      - Supervised Learning
      - Unsupervised Learning
      - Reinforcement Learning
      
   - AI 1950
      - the question was asked as to why machines could not use knowledge like humans to solve
      problems.
      - weak AI (Siri, Alexa)
      - General AI
      - Strong AI
      
      
   - Data Science
     - robots, fuzzy logic, expert systems
     
     - AGI: dream of AI of building machines to think like humans.
